# Plattarr module interface specification

Status: Approved by the owner 2026-10-20, revision 2. See
[Decision record](#decision-record).
Applies to: Phase 1 onward. Supersedes the draft list in
`claude/arr-combo-plan.md` section 3.

This document defines the seams between the Plattarr shared core and the
media modules (Movies, TV, Music). It is derived from how Radarr's movie code
plugs into its core today, checked against the same seams in Sonarr and
Lidarr.

"Module" is an internal code term. Users never see it. See
[Single pane of glass](#single-pane-of-glass).

## Summary

- The three apps grab, track, and import releases through the same pipeline.
  The only structural difference is the entity a release attaches to:
  one movie, several episodes of one series, or several albums of one artist.
  The spec models that as a **parent** plus **items**.
- The core talks to modules through seven contracts: module registration,
  release matching, search translation, decision specifications, download
  import, activity rendering, and notification payloads. Metadata providers,
  monitoring rules, naming, and quality profiles stay inside the module. The
  core never calls them.
- Qualities, languages, quality profiles, and custom formats are global.
  Upstream quality and language IDs collide between apps, so Plattarr has its
  own ID catalog and the importers remap. Each item can apply to all media
  types (the default) or be scoped to some.
- Indexers have one global setting each. Search categories are derived from
  the media type being searched; the user doesn't configure them.
- 52 of Sonarr's 62 `/api/v3` routes collide with Radarr's. The compatibility
  APIs get their own URL bases: `/radarr`, `/sonarr`, `/lidarr`. They are
  full-fidelity copies of the upstream APIs, not a captured subset, so
  third-party tools work unchanged.
- One schema, one migration chain, one version table.
- The module boundary is a namespace rule enforced by an architecture test.
  177 core files reference movie types today; the test starts with that list
  as an allowlist that may only shrink. No separate module assemblies.

## Single pane of glass

Owner's goal: the user picks what they want to download, and Plattarr does
the rest. The user never chooses or configures a "module".

Rules for every user-facing surface:

- **One library, one search.** The search bar takes a title and an optional
  media type filter: All (default), Movies, TV, Anime, Music. Results from
  every media type appear together, labeled by type. Adding an item asks only
  for what that item needs (monitoring, profile, folder) with global defaults
  pre-filled.
- **Anime is a filter, not a module.** Anime series are TV series with
  Sonarr's `Anime` series type, which changes episode numbering and search.
  Anime movies are movies. The Anime filter shows both. The series type is
  set automatically from metadata and can be changed per series.
- **Shared pages are shared.** Activity, queue, history, blocklist,
  calendar, wanted, indexers, download clients, notifications, and system
  are one page each, with a media type filter.
- **Settings are global first.** Quality profiles, custom formats, delay and
  release profiles, and media management settings apply to all media types
  unless the user scopes them. Per-type settings appear only where values
  can't be shared: root folders and naming formats.
- **Defaults remove decisions.** Download client categories, indexer
  categories, and the media type of a release are set automatically.
  Manual control sits behind "Advanced".
- **"Module" stays in the code.** UI text says "media type", or names the
  type.

Phase 1 ships with Radarr's UI, which already fits these rules for one
media type. The unified frontend (plan section 3, layer 4) is built against
these rules once TV exists, in Phase 3.

## Evidence

### The pipeline is the same in all three apps

Each app has the same release wrapper, with a different entity attached:

| Field | `RemoteMovie` (Radarr) | `RemoteEpisode` (Sonarr) | `RemoteAlbum` (Lidarr) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Release` (`ReleaseInfo`) | yes | yes | yes |
| `DownloadAllowed` | yes | yes | yes |
| `SeedConfiguration` | yes | yes | yes |
| `CustomFormats`, `CustomFormatScore` | yes | yes | yes |
| `ReleaseSource` | yes | yes | yes |
| `Languages` | yes | yes | no |
| Parsed info | `ParsedMovieInfo` | `ParsedEpisodeInfo` | `ParsedAlbumInfo` |
| Parent entity | `Movie` | `Series` | `Artist` |
| Child entities | none | `List<Episode>` | `List<Album>` |
| Recency (drives client priority) | `Movie.MovieMetadata.IsRecentMovie` | `IsRecentEpisode()` | `IsRecentAlbum()` |

The persisted activity records follow the same parent-plus-items shape:

| Record | Radarr | Sonarr | Lidarr |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Blocklist` | `MovieId` | `SeriesId`, `EpisodeIds` | `ArtistId`, `AlbumIds` |
| `PendingRelease` | `MovieId` | `SeriesId` | `ArtistId` |
| `DownloadHistory` | `MovieId` | `SeriesId` | `ArtistId` |
| History | `MovieId` | `SeriesId`, `EpisodeId` | `ArtistId`, `AlbumId`, `TrackId` |
| `Queue` | `Movie` | `Series`, `Episodes` | `Artist`, `Album` |

History is one row per item in Sonarr and Lidarr (one per episode, one per
track or album). Blocklist and pending releases are one row per release.

### Download clients use four movie-specific values

`IDownloadClient.Download` takes the module's release type in each app:
`Download(RemoteMovie, IIndexer)`, `Download(RemoteEpisode, IIndexer)`,
`Download(RemoteAlbum, IIndexer)`. Across Radarr's 18 clients, the client
code reads only these from the release:

- `Release` (URL, title, indexer).
- `SeedConfiguration`.
- The recency flag, to choose `RecentMoviePriority` or `OlderMoviePriority`.

And one value from settings: the category. Each app names it for its media:

| Setting | Radarr | Sonarr | Lidarr |
|---|---|---|---|
| Category | `MovieCategory` | `TvCategory` | `MusicCategory` |
| Post-import category | `MovieImportedCategory` | `TvImportedCategory` | `MusicImportedCategory` |
| Priorities | `RecentMoviePriority`, `OlderMoviePriority` | `RecentTvPriority`, `OlderTvPriority` | `RecentMusicPriority`, `OlderMusicPriority` |

`GetItems()` filters the client's queue by that category. The category is how
each app recognizes its own downloads.

### Decision specifications split cleanly

Of Radarr's 23 download decision specifications, 8 read only
`subject.Release`: `BlockedIndexer`, `MaximumSize`, `MinimumAge`,
`NotSample`, `RawDisk`, `RequiredIndexerFlags`, `Retention`, and
`TorrentSeeding`. Three more read the movie only for its tags or path:
`Protocol` (delay profile by tag), `ReleaseRestrictions` (tags), and
`FreeSpace` (path). The rest depend on the movie, its quality profile, or
its files.

Sonarr's specification set is a superset with TV-only rules (`FullSeason`,
`MultiSeason`, `SeasonPackOnly`, `SceneMapping`, `AnimeVersionUpgrade`,
`SplitEpisode`, `AirDate`). Lidarr adds `Discography`, `EarlyRelease`, and
`YearMatch`, and still uses the older signature
`Decision IsSatisfiedBy(RemoteAlbum, SearchCriteriaBase)`. Radarr and Sonarr
use `DownloadSpecDecision IsSatisfiedBy(subject, ReleaseDecisionInformation)`.
Lidarr's specifications need converting to the newer signature during the
Phase 4 port.

### Quality and language IDs collide

Quality IDs are persisted in profiles, history, and file records.

- Radarr and Sonarr define 21 of the same quality IDs. Three of them mean
  different things: ID 20 is Bluray-480p in Radarr and Bluray-1080p Remux in
  Sonarr; 21 is Bluray-576p and Bluray-2160p Remux; 22 is BR-DISK and
  Bluray-576p.
- Lidarr's 38 qualities are audio formats. 30 of its IDs reuse numbers that
  are video qualities in Radarr (for example, ID 1 is MP3-192 in Lidarr and
  SDTV in Radarr). Lidarr's `QualityParser.cs` shares almost no lines with
  Radarr's.
- Language IDs diverge from ID 26 upward. ID 26 is Hindi in Radarr and
  Arabic in Sonarr. Sonarr's `LanguageParser.cs` differs from Radarr's in
  506 of 596 lines.
- `ReleaseGroupParser.cs` differs by 20 of 87 lines between Radarr and
  Sonarr and carries no IDs.

Shared qualities and languages therefore need one Plattarr ID catalog and a
remap of every imported row. The catalogs are small: by name, Radarr and
Sonarr together define 33 video qualities, two of which are aliases
(Sonarr's "Bluray-1080p Remux" and "Bluray-2160p Remux" are Radarr's
"Remux-1080p" and "Remux-2160p"), so 31 distinct video qualities plus
Lidarr's 38 audio qualities. Radarr's 60 and Sonarr's 55 languages make 64
distinct names.

### Indexer settings carry consumer-side fields

Radarr's, Sonarr's, and Lidarr's Newznab and Torznab settings carry fields
that Prowlarr's indexer settings do not, because in Prowlarr they belong to
the app that consumes the indexer (they are pushed through `Applications`):

| Field | Radarr | Sonarr | Lidarr | Prowlarr indexer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Categories` | yes | yes | yes | no (has `Capabilities`) |
| `AnimeCategories`, `AnimeStandardFormatSearch` | no | yes | no | no |
| `MultiLanguages` | yes | yes | no | no |
| `RequiredFlags` | yes | no | no | no |
| `RemoveYear` | yes | no | no | no |
| `MinimumSeeders` | yes | yes | yes | no (`AppMinimumSeeders` is a sync value) |
| `SeedRatio`, `SeedTime` | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `SeasonPackSeed*` | no | yes | no | `PackSeedTime` |
| `DiscographySeedTime`, `EarlyReleaseLimit` | no | no | yes | no |
| `FailDownloads`, `RejectBlocklistedTorrentHashesWhileGrabbing` | yes | yes | partly | no |
| `EnableRss`, `EnableAutomaticSearch`, `EnableInteractiveSearch` | definition | definition | definition | no (`Enable` plus `AppProfile`) |

Deleting Prowlarr's `Applications` subsystem removes the place these settings
lived. They have to come back as global indexer settings plus optional overrides
(see [Indexer settings](#indexer-settings)).

### Search criteria names collide

Prowlarr's `IIndexer` already has one `Fetch` overload per media type:
`MovieSearchCriteria`, `TvSearchCriteria`, `MusicSearchCriteria`,
`BookSearchCriteria`, `BasicSearchCriteria`, all in
`NzbDrone.Core.IndexerSearch.Definitions`. Radarr defines its own
`MovieSearchCriteria` in the same namespace with a different shape (it holds
the `Movie` entity and scene titles). Sonarr defines seven criteria types
(single, season, daily, daily season, anime, anime season, special) that
Prowlarr's single `TvSearchCriteria` (`Season`, `Episode` as a string) must
represent.

### The DI container registers by convention

`NzbDrone.Common/Composition/Extensions.cs` `AutoAddServices` registers every
interface implementation in the listed assemblies (`Bootstrap.ASSEMBLIES`) as
a singleton. Several implementations of one interface resolve as
`IEnumerable<T>`. Modules can register by implementing core interfaces; no
explicit registration code is needed. The consequence is that two modules
cannot each define a type with the same full name, so module types must live
in module namespaces.

`Jobs/TaskManager.cs` hardcodes all 12 scheduled tasks, including
`RefreshMovieCommand`, `RefreshCollectionsCommand`, and `ImportListSyncCommand`.
`Datastore/TableMapping.cs` maps all 42 tables in one method.
`Datastore/Migration/Framework/MigrationController.cs` scans only
`Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()`.

### The compatibility APIs collide

Radarr's `Radarr.Api.V3` has 64 controller routes and Sonarr's
`Sonarr.Api.V3` has 62. 52 routes have the same path, including
`system/status`, `qualityprofile`, `rootfolder`, `tag`, `queue`, `history`,
`command`, and `config/*`. Both cannot serve `/api/v3` on one port.

### Current coupling

177 files outside the module-owned folders reference movie types
(`Movie`, `RemoteMovie`, `LocalMovie`, `MovieFile`, `ParsedMovieInfo`,
`MovieId`, `MovieMetadata`, `IMovieService`):

| Folder | Files | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `Notifications` | 58 | Every provider formats movie messages |
| `Download` | 47 | Clients, tracked downloads, pending, completed and failed handling |
| `Datastore` | 24 | Mostly upstream migrations; removed by `001_initial` |
| `Housekeeping` | 16 | Orphan cleanup per table |
| `Indexers` | 8 | Radarr request generators; replaced by Prowlarr's layer |
| `IndexerSearch` | 4 | |
| `History`, `Blocklisting`, `HealthCheck`, `MovieStats`, `Validation` | 3 each | |
| `Queue` | 2 | |
| `Tags`, `Exceptions`, `DiskSpace` | 1 each | |

Module-owned folders, excluded from the count: `Movies`, `MediaFiles`,
`DecisionEngine`, `ImportLists`, `Extras`, `Organizer`, `CustomFormats`,
`Qualities`, `MetadataSource`, `Profiles`, `AutoTagging`, `RootFolders`,
`Languages`, `MediaCover`, `Parser`.

## Design

### Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Module | One media type: Movies, TV, or Music. Identified by `MediaKind`. |
| Parent | The top-level library entity: `Movie`, `Series`, or `Artist`. |
| Item | The unit that gets a file: `Movie`, `Episode`, or `Album` (Lidarr tracks are files within an album). For Movies, parent and item are the same entity. |
| Release | One indexer result, wrapped in a module's `RemoteRelease` subclass once matched. |

### Boundary rules

1. Module code lives in `NzbDrone.Core.<Module>.*`: `NzbDrone.Core.Movies`,
   `NzbDrone.Core.Tv`, `NzbDrone.Core.Music`. Sonarr and Lidarr already use
   `Tv` and `Music` as their entity namespaces.
2. Core code never references a module type. It works with the abstract
   types in `NzbDrone.Core.Modules`.
3. A module may reference the core. A module never references another module.
4. Module-owned tables use the module prefix (`Movies_`, `Tv_`, `Music_`),
   as approved in the plan.
5. Rule 2 is enforced by an architecture test in `NzbDrone.Core.Test` that
   fails when a type outside `NzbDrone.Core.<Module>` references a type
   inside it. The test carries an allowlist of files, seeded with the 177
   found today. A change may remove entries; adding one fails review.

### Shared types

```csharp
namespace NzbDrone.Core.Modules
{
    // Stored in shared tables. Values never change once released.
    public enum MediaKind
    {
        Movies = 1,
        Tv = 2,
        Music = 3
    }

    // What the core needs to know about a parent entity.
    public interface IMediaParent
    {
        MediaKind Kind { get; }
        int Id { get; }
        string Title { get; }
        string Path { get; }
        HashSet<int> Tags { get; }
        int QualityProfileId { get; }
        bool Monitored { get; }
    }

    // Base for RemoteMovie, RemoteEpisode, RemoteAlbum.
    public abstract class RemoteRelease
    {
        public ReleaseInfo Release { get; set; }
        public bool DownloadAllowed { get; set; }
        public TorrentSeedConfiguration SeedConfiguration { get; set; }
        public List<CustomFormat> CustomFormats { get; set; }
        public int CustomFormatScore { get; set; }
        public List<Language> Languages { get; set; }
        public ReleaseSourceType ReleaseSource { get; set; }

        public abstract MediaKind Kind { get; }
        public abstract IMediaParent Parent { get; }
        public abstract IReadOnlyList<int> ItemIds { get; }
        public abstract bool IsRecent { get; }
    }
}
```

`ReleaseInfo` is Prowlarr's model plus `PendingReleaseReason`, as already
decided (plan section 3a, finding 5).

`CustomFormat` and `Language` appear on the base class because every
specification and the queue read them. Both are global types with Plattarr
IDs (see [Qualities, languages, profiles, and custom formats](#qualities-languages-profiles-and-custom-formats)).

### Contract 1: Module registration

```csharp
public interface IMediaModule
{
    MediaKind Kind { get; }
    string Name { get; }               // "Movies"
    string TablePrefix { get; }        // "Movies_"
    string CompatUrlBase { get; }      // "/radarr", "/sonarr", or null
    IReadOnlyList<int> DefaultCategories { get; }  // Newznab: 2000s, 5000s, 3000s

    void MapTables(TableMapper mapper);
    IEnumerable<ScheduledTaskDefinition> ScheduledTasks { get; }
}
```

- `TaskManager` builds its task list from core tasks plus every module's
  `ScheduledTasks`. Movies contributes `RefreshMovieCommand`,
  `RefreshCollectionsCommand`, and `ImportListSyncCommand`.
- `TableMapping` calls `MapTables` on each module after mapping core tables.
- `PLATTARR__MODULES__ENABLED` hides media types the user doesn't want (for
  example, no music). A hidden media type has no UI, runs no scheduled tasks,
  and receives no releases. Its tables still exist, empty, because the schema
  is one migration chain.

### Contract 2: Release matching

The core fetches RSS once per indexer and hands each release to the modules.

```csharp
public interface IReleaseMatcher
{
    MediaKind Kind { get; }

    // Parse and map a release to a library entity. Null when it doesn't match.
    RemoteRelease Map(ReleaseInfo release);

    // Rebuild a release for a tracked download from its grab history.
    RemoteRelease MapFromHistory(string sourceTitle, int parentId, IReadOnlyList<int> itemIds);

    // Map by title alone, for downloads with no history.
    RemoteRelease MapFromTitle(string title);
}
```

Routing for RSS results:

1. If the release has categories, offer it to each module whose configured
   categories for that indexer overlap. Usually one module.
2. If the release has no categories, offer it to every enabled module.
3. If more than one module returns a match, log a warning and keep both.
   The decision engine evaluates each independently. A grab by one module
   does not block the other.

Title parsing, scene mapping, and entity lookup stay inside `Map`. The core
does not parse titles.

### Contract 3: Search translation

Prowlarr's criteria types (`MovieSearchCriteria`, `TvSearchCriteria`,
`MusicSearchCriteria`) stay in `NzbDrone.Core.IndexerSearch.Definitions` and
belong to the core. Module search requests are renamed and move into the
module: Radarr's `MovieSearchCriteria` becomes
`NzbDrone.Core.Movies.Search.MovieSearchRequest`, Sonarr's seven criteria
become `Tv.Search.*Request`, and so on.

```csharp
public interface ISearchTranslator<TRequest>
    where TRequest : ModuleSearchRequest
{
    // One request can fan out (scene titles, alternate IDs, anime absolute numbers).
    IEnumerable<SearchCriteriaBase> Translate(TRequest request, IndexerDefinition indexer);
}
```

The core runs the translated criteria through Prowlarr's indexer layer,
applies rate limits and stats, then passes results back through the module's
`IReleaseMatcher.Map`. This is the in-process adapter in Phase 1 step 4.

Open item for Phase 3: Sonarr's daily and anime searches must fit
`TvSearchCriteria.Episode` (a string) without losing Sonarr's request
formats. Confirm against Prowlarr's Newznab generator before porting.

### Contract 4: Decision specifications

```csharp
// Core. Runs for every module.
public interface IReleaseSpecification
{
    SpecificationPriority Priority { get; }
    RejectionType Type { get; }
    DownloadSpecDecision IsSatisfiedBy(RemoteRelease subject, ReleaseDecisionInformation information);
}

// Module. Runs only for its own release type.
public interface IReleaseSpecification<in TRemote>
    where TRemote : RemoteRelease
{
    SpecificationPriority Priority { get; }
    RejectionType Type { get; }
    DownloadSpecDecision IsSatisfiedBy(TRemote subject, ReleaseDecisionInformation information);
}
```

The core `DownloadDecisionMaker` runs both sets, ordered by `Priority`, and
returns `DownloadDecision` with a `RemoteRelease`. `ReleaseDecisionInformation`
replaces the old search-criteria argument and carries a module request as
`ModuleSearchRequest` (null for RSS).

Core specifications (moved out of `DecisionEngine/Specifications`):
`BlockedIndexer`, `MaximumSize`, `MinimumAge`, `NotSample`, `RawDisk`,
`RequiredIndexerFlags`, `Retention`, `TorrentSeeding`, `Protocol`,
`ReleaseRestrictions`, `FreeSpace`. The last three use `IMediaParent.Tags`
and `IMediaParent.Path`.

Everything else stays in the module, including `Blocklist`, `Queue`,
`AlreadyImported`, upgrades, quality and custom format checks, delay, and
history.

Download prioritization (`DownloadDecisionComparer`) stays per module. The
comparison rules differ (Sonarr compares episode counts and season packs).

### Contract 5: Download import

```csharp
public interface IDownloadImporter
{
    MediaKind Kind { get; }

    // Import from the download's output path. Returns one result per file considered.
    List<ImportResult> Import(TrackedDownload trackedDownload, string outputPath, ImportMode mode);

    // True when every expected item has been imported, judged from history.
    bool IsImported(TrackedDownload trackedDownload, IReadOnlyList<HistoryItem> history);
}
```

The core keeps `TrackedDownloadService`, `CompletedDownloadService`,
`FailedDownloadService`, `IgnoredDownloadService`, `RejectedImportService`,
`ProvideImportItemService`, remote path mappings, and the hardlink-or-copy
transfer. The module owns file matching, renaming, extras, and the media file
tables.

`ImportResult` keeps its current shape (`ImportResultType`, errors) and
replaces the movie reference with `ItemIds`.

#### Tracked download routing

A download in the client must be attributed to one module before import:

1. `DownloadHistory` lookup by `DownloadId`. The row records `MediaKind`.
   This covers everything Plattarr grabbed.
2. The download client category. Each category maps to one module (see
   [Download client settings](#download-client-settings)).
3. Neither available (category empty or `*`, no history): ask each enabled
   module's `MapFromTitle`. Exactly one match wins. Zero or several matches
   leave the download in the queue with a `ManualInteractionRequired` warning.

### Contract 6: Activity

History, blocklist, pending releases, and download history are shared tables
so the activity pages can query one place:

| Table | New columns | Replaces |
|---|---|---|
| `History` | `MediaKind`, `ParentId`, `ItemId` | `MovieId` |
| `Blocklist` | `MediaKind`, `ParentId`, `ItemIds` (JSON) | `MovieId` |
| `PendingReleases` | `MediaKind`, `ParentId`, `ItemIds` (JSON) | `MovieId` |
| `DownloadHistory` | `MediaKind`, `ParentId` | `MovieId` |

Module-specific values go in the existing `Data` JSON column, as the apps do
today. `Queue` is built in memory from tracked downloads and needs no table.

```csharp
public interface IActivityRenderer
{
    MediaKind Kind { get; }

    // Display values for activity, queue, and calendar rows.
    ActivitySubject Describe(int parentId, IReadOnlyList<int> itemIds);
}

public class ActivitySubject
{
    public string ParentTitle { get; set; }   // "The Expanse"
    public string ItemLabel { get; set; }     // "S02E03", "(2019)", "Album Name"
    public string ParentPath { get; set; }
}
```

### Contract 7: Notifications

Phase 1 has only the Movies module, so notifications keep Radarr's
movie-typed messages and stay on the allowlist. Before Phase 3, messages
become module-neutral:

```csharp
public class GrabMessage
{
    public MediaKind Kind { get; set; }
    public ActivitySubject Subject { get; set; }
    public RemoteRelease Release { get; set; }
    public string QualityName { get; set; }
    public string DownloadClientName { get; set; }
    public string DownloadId { get; set; }
}
```

Providers that only send text (Discord, Telegram, and most others) format
from `Subject`. Providers that send structured payloads (Webhook, Custom
Script) switch on `Kind` and emit that module's upstream payload shape, so
existing receivers keep working. The Jellyfin library refresh only needs
`Subject.ParentPath`.

Per-module events (`OnMovieAdded`, `OnSeriesAdd`, `OnArtistAdd`) become one
`OnMediaAdded` and similar, each with a `MediaKind`. Notification settings
gain a per-media-type toggle so a user can, for example, notify on movie grabs
only.

### Download client settings

`IDownloadClient.Download` takes `RemoteRelease`. Client settings replace the
movie-named fields with a per-module list:

```csharp
public class ModuleCategorySettings
{
    public MediaKind Kind { get; set; }
    public string Category { get; set; }
    public string ImportedCategory { get; set; }
    public int RecentPriority { get; set; }
    public int OlderPriority { get; set; }
}
```

Defaults: `plattarr-movies`, `plattarr-tv`, and `plattarr-music`, filled in
when a client is added, so the user doesn't have to think about categories.
The client settings page shows them under an "Advanced" toggle.

Validation: within one client, each media type's category must be unique
and non-empty. Routing step 2 depends on it.

The migration importer maps Radarr's `MovieCategory` to the Movies entry.
When `sonarr.db` is imported in Phase 3 and a client with the same host and
port exists, the importer adds a TV entry to that row instead of creating a
second client.

Owner's setup: qBittorrent behind gluetun with one save path
(`/mnt/share/Media/Importing`). Separate categories per module are required
before TV is enabled, or routing falls to title parsing.

### Indexer settings

Each indexer has one global setting. There is no per-media-type indexer
configuration in the default UI.

- **Enable flags.** `EnableRss`, `EnableAutomaticSearch`, and
  `EnableInteractiveSearch` move onto the shared indexer definition and apply
  to every media type.
- **Seeding.** `SeedRatio`, `SeedTime`, `PackSeedTime`, and
  `MinimumSeeders` are global per indexer. `PackSeedTime` covers Sonarr's
  season packs and Lidarr's discographies.
- **Categories.** Derived, not configured. Prowlarr already maps every
  indexer's native categories to the standard Newznab tree in its
  capabilities. A search for movies uses the indexer's 2000-range
  categories, TV uses 5000, anime uses 5070, music uses 3000. RSS results are
  routed by the same tree (Contract 2).
- **Indexer-wide flags.** `FailDownloads` and
  `RejectBlocklistedTorrentHashesWhileGrabbing` move onto the shared indexer
  definition.

As built in porting step 6 (`ec0d294`): the three enable flags are columns
on `IndexerDefinition` (default true) beside Prowlarr's `Enable`, which stays
the master switch. `FailDownloads` is in `IndexerBaseSettings`.
`MinimumSeeders` (Prowlarr's `AppMinimumSeeders`, default 1) and
`RejectBlocklistedTorrentHashesWhileGrabbing` are in
`IndexerTorrentBaseSettings`, next to the seed ratio and times. Settings
blocks render as indexer form fields, so they need no API or UI work of their
own. `IndexerOverrides` waits for step 7, its first reader.

Some upstream per-app fields have no global equivalent: `MultiLanguages`,
`RequiredFlags`, `RemoveYear` (Radarr), `AnimeStandardFormatSearch` (Sonarr),
`EarlyReleaseLimit` (Lidarr), and a manual category override for indexers
that miscategorize. These live in an optional `IndexerOverrides` table, one
row per indexer and media type, edited from an "Advanced" section on the
indexer page. Rows exist only when a user sets one. Defaults are empty, and
most users never see the section.

The migration importer fills global values from `prowlarr.db` first. Values
from `radarr.db` or `sonarr.db` that differ from the global value become
override rows, so nothing the user configured is lost.

### Configuration

Settings are global by default. A setting that can reasonably differ between
media types can be overridden for one media type.

- **Global only:** `CalendarWeekColumnHeader`, `DownloadClientHistoryLimit`,
  `DownloadClientWorkingFolders`, `EnableColorImpairedMode`,
  `EnableCompletedDownloadHandling`, `FirstDayOfWeek`, `LongDateFormat`,
  `MaximumSize`, `MinimumAge`, `Retention`, `RssSyncInterval`,
  `ShortDateFormat`, `ShowRelativeDates`, `TimeFormat`,
  `TrustCgnatIpAddresses`, `UILanguage`.
- **Global with per-media-type override:** `AutoRedownloadFailed`,
  `AutoRedownloadFailedFromInteractiveSearch`, `ChmodFolder`, `ChownGroup`,
  `CleanupMetadataImages`, `CopyUsingHardlinks`, `DeleteEmptyFolders`,
  `DownloadPropersAndRepacks`, `EnableMediaInfo`, `ExtraFileExtensions`,
  `FileDate`, `ImportExtraFiles`, `ListSyncLevel`,
  `MinimumFreeSpaceWhenImporting`, `RecycleBin`, `RecycleBinCleanupDays`,
  `RescanAfterRefresh`, `ScriptImportPath`, `SetPermissionsLinux`,
  `SkipFreeSpaceCheckWhenImporting`, `UseScriptImport`.

Storage: the global value uses the plain key (`RecycleBin`). An override uses
a prefixed key (`Movies.RecycleBin`). `ConfigService` reads the override
first, then the global value. Radarr has 50 `ConfigService` keys and Sonarr
49; the 38 they share are all in the two lists above. `ConfigKey` is a
helper, not a setting.

Media-type-only settings (for example, Sonarr's episode naming tokens) are
not overrides; they belong to that media type's settings page.

### Qualities, languages, profiles, and custom formats

- **One global quality catalog** with Plattarr IDs: about 31 video qualities
  (the union of Radarr's and Sonarr's, aliases merged) and Lidarr's 38 audio
  qualities. Each quality records which media types it applies to (video
  qualities: movies and TV; audio: music).
- **One global language catalog** with Plattarr IDs: the 64 distinct names
  from Radarr and Sonarr. Lidarr has no release-language model to merge.
- **Parsers stay per media type, output is global.** Video and audio quality
  detection are different programs (Lidarr's `QualityParser.cs` shares almost
  nothing with Radarr's), so each module keeps its parser, and every parser
  returns catalog qualities and languages. The Radarr and Sonarr video
  parsers are 80% the same; merging them is optional later work, not
  required.
- **Quality profiles and custom formats are global.** Each has an
  `AppliesTo` set of media types, defaulting to every type its qualities
  support. A "1080p" profile created once serves movies and TV; a "Lossless"
  profile serves music. A user who wants a different profile for TV picks one
  per series, the same as today, or creates a TV-only profile.
- **Import remap.** The importers translate each upstream quality and
  language ID to a catalog ID with a static name table, including the two
  alias pairs. Profiles and custom formats imported from Radarr and Sonarr
  that are identical after remap are merged into one; others are kept and
  scoped to their source media type.
- **API remap.** The compatibility APIs translate catalog IDs back to the
  upstream app's IDs, so tools that send Radarr or Sonarr quality IDs
  (Recyclarr, Jellyseerr) keep working (see
  [Compatibility APIs](#compatibility-apis)).
- Release group parsing moves to the core.

Trade-off: upstream quality parser fixes that add a new quality need a new
catalog entry and a remap row. That happens a few times a year at most.

### Other tables

Global, optionally scoped to media types with `AppliesTo`: delay profiles,
release profiles, tags, auto-tagging, import list exclusions.

Per media type, because the values can't be shared: root folders (a movie
folder and a TV folder are different places), naming formats, import lists
(each list type returns one media type), metadata consumers, and all media
and file tables (module-prefixed).

Shared with no scoping: remote path mappings, indexers and their status,
download clients and their status, notifications and their status, users,
config, commands, logs, scheduled tasks, custom filters.

### Database migrations

One FluentMigrator chain and one `VersionInfo` table for the whole schema,
starting at `001_initial`. All migrations live in the core project's
`Datastore/Migration` folder; module code adds tables through ordinary
numbered migrations.

- Phase 1's `001_initial` creates the core tables, the global catalogs, and
  the `Movies_` tables.
- Phase 3 adds the `Tv_` tables in a later migration; Phase 4 adds `Music_`.
- Hidden media types still have their tables. An empty table costs nothing.

### Compatibility APIs

Goal: tools built for Radarr, Sonarr, and Lidarr work against Plattarr
unchanged, with only the URL base changed in their settings.

| URL base | Emulates | Source of the controllers |
|---|---|---|
| `/radarr/api/v3` | Radarr v3 | Radarr's `Radarr.Api.V3`, which Plattarr already contains |
| `/sonarr/api/v3` | Sonarr v3 | Sonarr's `Sonarr.Api.V3`, ported with the TV module |
| `/lidarr/api/v1` | Lidarr v1 | Lidarr's `Lidarr.Api.V1`, ported with the Music module |
| `/{indexerId}/api` | Prowlarr's per-indexer Newznab and Torznab feeds | Prowlarr's `NewznabController`, ported with the indexer layer |

Design:

- **Full fidelity, not a subset.** Each URL base serves the upstream app's
  complete API surface, because the controllers are the upstream
  controllers. This reverses the 2026-10-20 "captured subset only" scope.
  Phase 2 still records Jellyseerr's real calls through a logging proxy, now
  as a test fixture rather than a scope limit.
- **Shared data, upstream shapes.** Resources that are global in Plattarr
  (`tag`, `qualityprofile`, `customformat`, `qualitydefinition`,
  `downloadclient`, `indexer`, `notification`, `system/status`) are read from
  the global tables and shaped as the upstream app would return them.
  `qualityprofile` under `/radarr` returns profiles whose `AppliesTo`
  includes movies, with Radarr quality IDs.
- **ID translation.** Quality and language IDs are translated in both
  directions at the shim boundary. Entity IDs (movie, series, artist) need no
  translation because each media type owns its own table.
- **One API key.** All URL bases accept Plattarr's API key.
- **Identity.** `system/status` reports `appName` `Radarr`, `Sonarr`, or
  `Lidarr` under the matching base. Tools use it to detect the app type.
- The existing Radarr UI keeps calling `/api/v3` until the unified frontend
  replaces it. During Phase 1, `/api/v3` and `/radarr/api/v3` serve the same
  controllers.

Not emulated: Prowlarr's own management API (`/api/v1/indexer` and so on).
Tools that read it are dashboards (Homepage, Homarr) and mobile apps.
Revisit if one the owner uses needs it.

Delivery is on demand. The design keeps every tool reachable, but testing
and fixes happen in this order:

1. **Required for cutover (Phase 2):** Jellyseerr, the only tool in use
   today. Plattarr can't replace the live apps until a Jellyseerr request
   works end to end.
2. **Owner's next tool:** Homarr. Its Radarr, Sonarr, and Lidarr widgets
   read the URL bases above. Its indexer widget reads Prowlarr's management
   API, which is not emulated; that widget is deferred until requested.
3. **Everything else, when a user asks:** Overseerr, Ombi, Bazarr,
   Recyclarr, Notifiarr, Unpackerr, autobrr, cross-seed (Torznab feeds),
   Maintainerr, Kometa, Homepage, and mobile clients such as LunaSea, nzb360,
   and Ruddarr. Each is a test-and-fix task, not new API work, because the
   endpoints are already the upstream ones.

What must be right from Phase 1 so on-demand integrations stay cheap: the
URL base routing, and quality and language ID translation at the API
boundary. Both are needed anyway, for Jellyseerr and for the importers.

Open item, per tool as it is tested: confirm it accepts a URL base. Most
expose one as a field or accept it in the host URL. A tool that hardcodes
`/api/v3` at the server root gets the Radarr API at `/api/v3` by default;
which app answers at the bare root is a setting.

### What stays inside a module

The core does not call these, so they are not part of the interface. Each
module keeps its upstream code:

- Metadata provider (TMDB, TheTVDB via Sonarr's proxy, MusicBrainz via
  Lidarr's proxy) and refresh.
- Entity model, monitoring rules, and wanted (missing and cutoff unmet).
- Naming and folder templates.
- Import lists, extras, and media covers.
- The quality and language parsers (output is global, see above).
- The module's compatibility API controllers.

## Phase 1 work this implies

In porting order (plan section 3a):

| Step | Spec work |
|---|---|
| 2. Port Prowlarr indexers | Keep Prowlarr's `IndexerSearch.Definitions` names. Rename Radarr's `MovieSearchCriteria` to `Movies.Search.MovieSearchRequest` first so the port doesn't collide. Move enable and seed settings onto the shared indexer definition; add `IndexerOverrides`. Keep Prowlarr's Newznab and Torznab feed controller. |
| 3. Swap `ReleaseInfo` | Add `RemoteRelease`, `IMediaParent`, `MediaKind`. Make `RemoteMovie` derive from `RemoteRelease`. |
| 4. Indexer adapter | `IReleaseMatcher` and `ISearchTranslator` for Movies. Category derivation from capabilities. RSS routing by category. |
| 5. Collapse migrations | One chain from `001_initial`: core tables, global quality and language catalogs, `Movies_` tables, activity tables with `MediaKind`. Move Radarr's quality and language parser output to catalog IDs. |
| 6. Module boundary | Move movie code to `NzbDrone.Core.Movies.*`. Add the architecture test and allowlist. Split core specifications, `IDownloadImporter`, `IMediaModule`, client category settings. Serve `/radarr/api/v3` alongside `/api/v3`. |

Exit check for the boundary: the allowlist has only `Notifications` entries
left. Notifications move off it before Phase 3.

## Decision record

Owner answers, 2026-10-20, to the six questions in revision 1:

| # | Question | Answer | Effect on the spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Shared or prefixed activity tables | Shared | As proposed: `History`, `Blocklist`, `PendingReleases`, `DownloadHistory` with `MediaKind`. |
| 2 | Quality and language parsing per module | Global by default, granular when wanted | Revised: global quality and language catalogs with Plattarr IDs, global profiles and custom formats with `AppliesTo`, importer and API remaps. Parsers stay per media type. |
| 3 | Compatibility URL bases | Compatible with most popular tools | Revised: full-fidelity Radarr v3, Sonarr v3, and Lidarr v1 APIs plus Prowlarr's per-indexer feeds. Reverses the Jellyseerr-only, captured-subset scope. |
| 4 | Per-module indexer settings | One global setting per indexer | Revised: global enable and seed settings, derived categories, optional advanced overrides only. |
| 5 | Migration chains | All in one | Revised: one chain, one `VersionInfo`. |
| 6 | Boundary enforcement | Claude's call | Architecture test with a shrinking allowlist. No separate module assemblies: with one schema, one UI, and no plugin loading, an assembly split adds build work and no user benefit. The test catches the same violations in CI. Revisit only for Phase 6 third-party modules. |

Guiding principle from the owner: Plattarr is a single pane of glass. See
[Single pane of glass](#single-pane-of-glass).
